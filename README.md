# Bdk Swift Sample app

This project is an example app / testbed for `bdk` (Bitcoin Dev Kit) Swift bindings. Features include syncing to testnet, sending and receiving fake Bitcoin, and QR code scanning. It started out life as a hackathon project by @futurepaul and @konjoinfinity.

Bdk Swift Sample App is strongly inspired by Thunderbiscuit's [Bitcoindevkit Android Demo Wallet](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/bitcoindevkit-android-sample-app) with the primary differences being the choice of color scheme and operating system.
